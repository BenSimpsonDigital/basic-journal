Button Dock Update Plan (Onboarding + Daily Entry + Sweep)
 Goal
- Make primary/forward actions feel like a bottom “action dock”: pinned to bottom, near full width, tall pill, filled.
- Make secondary actions (“Not right now”, “Maybe later”) an outline capsule of the **same size/width** as primary.
- Match the layout/hierarchy from the reference screenshots while using Basic Journal’s existing visual system and tokens.
- Follow `PROJECT_PLAYBOOK.md` (“Bottom Dock Actions”, “hero -> supporting -> controls”, “glass sparingly”).
 Dock Specs (From References + Playbook)
- **Placement:** pinned above home indicator using `safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom)`
- **Width:** near full width with `Theme.Spacing.lg` (24) side insets
- **Layout:** vertical stack: primary on top, secondary below; spacing `Theme.Spacing.md` (16)
- **Button size:** consistent tall pill (~56pt height), same width for both
- **Primary:** filled capsule, `Theme.Colors.accent`, white text, subtle press scale
- **Secondary:** outline capsule, no fill, stroke `Theme.Colors.textPrimary.opacity(0.25)`, text `Theme.Colors.textPrimary`
- **Disabled state (e.g., Next before mood selected):** keep geometry identical; reduce opacity and disable interaction (no layout jump)
- **Readability layer:** include a subtle bottom fade behind the dock (scrim) so buttons remain readable over bright mood gradients
 Phase 1 — Create Canonical Dock + Styles (Shared)
- Add a reusable `BottomActionDock` view/component that:
  - Renders the **fade/scrim** behind the dock:
    - `LinearGradient` from transparent (top) -> `Theme.Colors.background` (bottom)
    - Keep it subtle; avoid heavy panels (playbook: “glass sparingly”)
  - Renders 1–2 full-width capsule buttons (primary + optional secondary)
  - Applies consistent padding:
    - Horizontal: `Theme.Spacing.lg`
    - Vertical: comfortable spacing above safe area + between buttons
- Add two canonical styles (token-driven; no hardcoded colors/fonts):
  - `PrimaryDockButtonStyle` (filled capsule)
  - `SecondaryDockButtonStyle` (outline capsule)
 Phase 2 — Update Onboarding
- File: `Views/OnboardingView.swift`
- Replace the current bottom button layout with:
  - `safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom) { BottomActionDock(...) }`
- Primary:
  - “Continue” / “Get Started” (filled, full width)
- Secondary:
  - none for now (unless later you add “Skip”, which becomes the outline capsule)
 Phase 3 — Update Daily Entry Flow (Today)
- File: `Views/TodayView.swift`
- Render **one** bottom dock at a stable container level (screen-level), driven by `viewModel.flowState` to prevent layout jumps and keep controls thumb-reachable.
 State-to-Dock Mapping
- `.startingPrompt`
  - Primary: “Let’s record” (filled)
  - Secondary: “Not right now” (outline capsule)
- `.selectMood`
  - Primary: “Next” (filled), always present
  - Disabled until `selectedMood != nil` (avoid appear/disappear jump)
- `.saved`
  - Primary: “Done” (filled)
- `.recordPrompt`
  - Recommended: primary action is also bottom-docked for consistency:
    - Either “Start recording” (filled), or relocate `VoiceInputPill` into the dock area
- `.recording`
  - Typically no dock (stop control remains the primary interaction); add a secondary outline “Cancel” only if needed
 Cleanup
- Remove/replace inline button blocks inside:
  - `StartingPromptView`
  - `MoodSelectionStepView`
  - `SimpleSavedStateView`
- Adjust any fixed bottom spacers/padding so scroll content isn’t covered by the dock; prefer dock-aware padding over hardcoded `Spacer(minLength: ...)`.
 Phase 4 — Sweep Other Screens (Only Where It Makes Sense)
- Scan for screens that present a true “primary + secondary CTA” pattern.
- Apply the same dock pattern only to those screens; do not force it onto list/navigation rows.
- Current inventory notes:
  - `Views/SearchView.swift`, `Views/TimelineView.swift`, `Views/SettingsView.swift`: no primary/secondary CTA to dock currently (leave as-is).
  - `Views/EntryDetailView.swift`: destructive “Delete Entry” uses a confirmation dialog; keep as-is unless explicitly redesigning that screen’s action hierarchy.
 QA / Acceptance Criteria
- Dock sits above the home indicator; buttons are near full width with `Theme.Spacing.lg` margins.
- Primary/secondary hierarchy is obvious (filled vs outline), both same size.
- No layout jumps between Today flow states; disabled states keep the same geometry.
- Contrast holds over brightest mood gradients (scrim helps); avoid heavy text shadows.
- Tap targets >= 44pt, Dynamic Type safe, Reduce Motion respected.
- Verify on iPhone 15 simulator and at least one smaller device size if supported.
